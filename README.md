# I.T Departement Software

I've worked as an I.T engineer for almost 6+ years, and I had struggled with managing and arranding the daily tasks of the departement.
I've tried more than one programm to keep things arranged but always there was something missing, So, I've decided to build one myself.
My goal is to build an opensourse software to manage the I.T departement issues, after finishing the first version of it I'm going
to deploy and test it in other companies for free just to get the feedback and then enhance it.

## What issues can be handled with this software ?

1- The departement inventory.
2- The devices status and specs.
3- Ticketing system.
4- Password manager.
5- Renewal dates for software licenses and cloud services.

## Technologies used

This software is a web application built with the following technologies: -
1- React.js (and the needed libraries from React eco-system).
2- Bootstrap5.

## How to install the software ?
